Bored and want to discuss a random topic with a stranger?

This web application pairs you up with a random stranger and generates a random topic to discuss about.

A topic is a word randomly selected from an API:
https://www.randomlists.com/data/words.json

The app uses socket.io to handle almost everything, and uses React js for front end.
